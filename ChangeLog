2002-08-08 14:07  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.18):

	- Fixed version portability warning under perl-5.8.0.
	
	- Fixed bug in test for extant methods.
	
2002-08-08 14:06  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* Makefile.PL (1.4):

	- Added dist target.
	
2002-07-17 10:43  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* Makefile.PL (1.3):

	Fixed VERSION_FROM bug.
	
2000-09-06 10:07  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.17):

	Finally tracked down the bug first reported by Tim Falzone <tim.falzone@active.com> which
		occurred when working with classes which all inherit from
		Class::Translucent, and which use each other one or more times. This would
		cause a class's methods not to be auto-generated if it was the
		first-occurring member in a recursive 'use'.
	
2000-08-07 09:14  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.16):

	Updated auto-generated documentation.
	
2000-08-07 09:13  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* README (1.2):

	Updated.
	
2000-08-07 09:11  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* README (1.1):

	Initial release
	
2000-08-07 09:06  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.15):

	Modified declaration of %template hash in _buildAccessors() so it isn't lexical
		when we (potentially) alias it later.
	
2000-07-31 19:23  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.14):

	Added a importToLevel() method to allow overridden import() methods to
		still use Class::Translucent's method generation.
	
	Fixed docs for import() which incorrectly specified a $class first argument.
	
2000-07-22 21:51  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.13):

	/ Fixed mistyped @ISA in the pod header. (Terrence Brannon <princepawn@yahoo.com>)
	
2000-07-17 23:25  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.12):

	/ Touched up and added some documentation
	
2000-07-17 16:18  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* Makefile.PL (1.2):

	/ Touched up and added requirements hashref
	
2000-07-17 16:17  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.11):

	/ Moved more of _buildAccessors() out into subordinate methods.
	
	/ Modified template fetching to alias the actual hash instead of copying it.
	
2000-07-17 16:14  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.10):

	Tweaked documentation
	
2000-06-17 19:23  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.9):

	/ Added methods for the various parts of the accessors so they can be
		overloaded. Polymorphism actually doesn't work yet because the template parts
		are used at BEGIN time, and the methods which would override the ones this
		class defines are only accessable if the calling class has already defined
		its @ISA, which we can't really rely on.
	
2000-05-18 13:46  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.8):

	/ Hacked a bunch of Perl 5.6 optimizations into it
	
2000-03-03 14:14  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.7):

	/ Fixed supermethod stuff to honor methods that are inherited as well as explicitly defined
		in the target class
	
2000-03-02 20:19  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.6):

	/ Modified array and hash accessors to return a list in list context
	
2000-02-28 16:16  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.5):

	+ Added superclass accessors to allow $self->SUPER::accessorMethod() calls to work. This
		allows one to override the auto-generated accessors without clobbering them.
	
2000-02-18 09:29  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.4):

	/ Modified to duplicate class data upon per-object attribute creation. This
		means that calling $object->pushTranslucentMethod( $something ) will first
		copy the class data at the moment of the call into the per-object attribute
		before pushing the new data.
	
	+ Added a test for inherited methods to _buildAccessors() so we don't clobber
		polymorphism.
	
	/ Lots of documentation updates/edits/refinements.
	
1999-12-12 04:19  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.3):

	+ Added an import() method so that we can use the 'use' mechanism to do
		method-generation instead of relying on a call to the
		constructor. This makes it possible to call class methods before
		the first object is instantiated. This is a Good Thing [tm].
	
	/ Re-arranged code-generation templates so they occur in the order
		they are used in the generated method code.
	
	+ Added lots more docs. Still incomplete, though. =:(
	
	/ Isolated the 'no strict q{refs}' to little codeblocks so we can
		still bask in the glory of strict-ness for most of the rest of the
		code.
	
	+ Added a method counter to _buildAccessors()
	
	+ Added a test for a method that's already defined with the current
		one being generated to avoid clobbering overrides.
	
	+ Added a _debugMsg() function to print stuff to STDERR with current
		position, etc.
	
1999-12-02 12:55  Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* test.pl (1.2), lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.2):

	/ Fixed a bug in the access-check generation code that didn't simulate
	  'protected' and 'private' accurately.
	+ Added some more documentation

	* Makefile.PL (1.1.1.1), test.pl (1.1.1.1),
	lib/Class/Translucent.pm (1.1.1.1) (utags: Beta_1_1):

	Initial release.
