	* Translucent.pm: Finally tracked down the bug first reported by
		Tim Falzone <tim.falzone@active.com> which occurred when
		working with classes which all inherit from
		Class::Translucent, and which use each other one or more
		times. This would cause a class's methods not to be
		auto-generated if it was the first-occurring member in a
		recursive 'use'.

	* Translucent.pm: 

	    Updated auto-generated documentation.

	    Modified declaration of %template hash in
		_buildAccessors() so it isn't lexical when we
		(potentially) alias it later.

	* Translucent.pm: Added a importToLevel() method to allow
		overridden import() methods to still use
		Class::Translucent's method generation.

	Fixed docs for import() which incorrectly specified a $class first
		argument.
